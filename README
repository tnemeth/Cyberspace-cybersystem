CYBERSYSTEM

        This project is a solar system pseudo simulation environment. A
        number of planets can be created, along with space stations, gates
        to other systems and asteroids belts/clouds.

        Clients can connect to the server.

        All objects have their position calculated and transmitted back
        to the clients.

        The system is not yet fully designed...
